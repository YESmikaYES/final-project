Should it pass our strict quality and safety control tests it will be listed for other users to see and rent. This of course means you will receive a majority cut of the money from each renting, without having to care for anything! Should your own vehicle be damaged during renting, we ourselves will make sure it recieves the necessary repairs it needs, and will get it back to fully operational as soon as possible</p>
